# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
 I think the fact that there was more data involved made this model more effective than the previous lessons model. 


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model? 
The R squared coefficient tells us that the model is either weak or strong. 


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
 I think it's slighly accurate just because of the fact that not all data is acurate, some of it can be predicted and within the context it wouldn't be entirely reliable.
