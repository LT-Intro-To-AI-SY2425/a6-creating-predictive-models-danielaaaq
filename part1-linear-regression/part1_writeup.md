# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model? 
The r squared value is the correlation within  a data set, in which it'd showcase how strong/ positive the regression model would be. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
 The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old is 123.47 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? 
I'd say the models prediction is somewhat accurate, however with limited data it fails to make the results stronger. I do think it can be used to predict someones blood pressure based on their age, but not to determine it truly.
