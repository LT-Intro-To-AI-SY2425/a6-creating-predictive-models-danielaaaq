## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Blue =  Super Saver --  Doesn't spend much 
Orange =   Not Smart Spender -- Spends, low income 
Red = Big Spender -- Spends a lot, high income 
Green =  Moderrate Shopper -- middle group, middle spending habit
Purple = Moddest Spender -- in between 

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
Group blue , they save while spending little. 

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
Maybe green, because I try saving some of my money while also trying to spend on items I might like.
